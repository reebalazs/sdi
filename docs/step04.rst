=======================
Step 04: Pyramid Layout
=======================

- Combine templating and code for SDI into a "layout"

Notes
=====

- Adds pyramid_layout to setup.py

- Add to .ini

- XXX pyramid_layout in .ini doesn't load, had to put in __init__.

- Make helpers in the Layout class for static stuff

- We now have a couple of views

- Links between "Home" and "Contents"
