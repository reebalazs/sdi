"Building an SDI" Tutorial
==========================

Substance D is a great framework for building a certain style of
content-oriented applications. It includes a slick admin UI called the
Substance D Interface (SDI).

What is this SDI? What isn't this SDI? How was it made? What if I want
to make an SDI-like UI for my retail application.

This tutorial builds an SDI from scratch, as a series of steps. In each
step we add something, discussing the "why" as well as the "how".
